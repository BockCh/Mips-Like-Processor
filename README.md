# Mips-Like-MicroProcessor
Designed, simulated, and created a functional 32-bit microprocessor with an instruction set similar to MIPS. 
This project is called a Mips-like processor because its architecutre is modeled off of MIPS and instantiates 32 instructions from 
MIPS instruction set.
# Getting Started
To learn more about MIPS if this is your first microprocessor project.
- [MIPS Instruction Set and Architecture](https://www.mips.com/products/architectures/mips32-2/)
- [MIPS Architecture Modules](https://www.mips.com/products/architectures/ase/)

All the Files necessary to simulate on ModelSim or put on your FPGA are available in this repository.
I reccomend creating your own ModelSim or Quartus project for testing purposes.
Screenshots of the microprocessor in the RTL Viewer are in the image file.
